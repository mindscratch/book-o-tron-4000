A web-based application used for the management and distribution of technical learning resources like books, e-books, videos and other training materials. book-o-tron-4000 utilizes a common jee stack and exposes its services through a flex-based client. This project is intended to facilitate the exploration of the spring framework's ability to rapidly develop a decoupled n-tier system while providing a platform for discussion within a classroom setting. And to get us chicks, boats, sports cars, and mansions...or maybe just some time off.

This project is continually being developed as a learning platform and to provide some tangible for real world use.  Currently, it requires a developer-minded person to build the code to have a working application.
